# AI File Organizer for macOS (LLM-Powered Edition)

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Introduction

This project aims to develop an intelligent macOS application, the "AI File Organizer," designed to automate and significantly enhance the process of organizing files and folders. The application will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily locally via Ollama in its initial MVP, and later through cloud-based services for premium features, to understand file content, metadata, and user context, enabling semantic organization beyond traditional rule-based systems.

### 1.2. Problem Statement

Many macOS users struggle with cluttered digital workspaces (e.g., Desktop, Downloads). Manual file organization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and often neglected. Existing tools lack the intelligence to understand file content semantically or adapt to individual user organization patterns.

### 1.3. Proposed Solution

A native macOS application that allows users to select target folders for organization. The initial MVP will focus on utilizing local LLMs (via Ollama) to analyze files and propose intelligent, semantically relevant folder structures and file placements. Users will have full control to review, modify, and approve suggestions, with an essential "undo" capability. The solution will initially offer a free/local tier powered by the user's Ollama instance, with a premium SaaS tier incorporating cloud LLMs planned for later stages.

### 1.4. Project Goals

- To provide an intuitive and powerful automated file organization tool for macOS users.
    
- To leverage local LLMs (via Ollama) for privacy-centric, on-device intelligence as the core MVP.
    
- To offer advanced organizational capabilities through cloud LLMs in a SaaS model in subsequent versions.
    
- To enable users to define organization rules and preferences.
    
- To ensure user control through a transparent review and approval process with an essential undo mechanism.
    
- To learn and adapt to user preferences and existing organizational structures through user feedback and corrections.
    

### 1.5. Target Audience

- **Primary:** macOS users who accumulate digital files and desire a more organized system but lack the time or inclination for manual sorting (e.g., professionals, creatives, students, general users with cluttered Downloads/Desktop folders).
    
- **Secondary:** Tech-savvy users comfortable with setting up and using local LLMs (Ollama) who prioritize privacy and control – this group is the initial MVP focus.
    
- **Tertiary:** Users willing to pay for premium, hassle-free AI-powered features without managing local LLM setups – targeted for post-MVP.
    

## 2. Core Functionality & Features

### 2.1. Targeted Folder Organization

- Users can select specific folders on their Mac (e.g., Desktop, Downloads, Documents, custom project folders) for the app to organize.
    

### 2.2. LLM-Powered Semantic Organization

- Utilizes LLMs (local via Ollama for MVP) to analyze file contents (summaries, key elements), metadata (name, type, dates), and contextual information.
    
- Creates semantically relevant folder structures (e.g., "Project Alpha Q3 Reports," "Vacation Photos Italy 2023," "Tax Documents 2022") rather than just by file type.
    
- Infers relationships between files to group them logically.
    

### 2.3. Adaptive Learning & Folder Suggestions

- **[MVP - Basic]**: The LLM can be prompted to learn from the user's existing manual organization habits or existing folder structures through few-shot prompting.
    
- **[Post-MVP - Enhanced]**: Explicit user feedback on accepted/rejected suggestions and corrections will be used to refine future LLM prompts and improve personalized organization schemes over time (reinforcement learning from human feedback).
    
- Proposes dynamic, content-aware folder names.
    

### 2.4. Natural Language Custom Rules

- **[Post-MVP]**: Users can define organization rules using natural language (e.g., "Move all invoices from last month into 'Invoices - [Month] [Year]'").
    
- The LLM interprets these instructions to apply custom sorting logic.
    

### 2.5. Review and Approve Mechanism (Crucial)

- The app presents a clear "preview" of the LLM's proposed organization plan (which files move to which new/existing folders).
    
- Users can approve, modify individual suggestions, or reject the entire plan before any file operations are executed. This mechanism also serves as a crucial point for users to provide feedback/corrections to improve future LLM suggestions.
    

### 2.6. Scheduled Organization

- **[Post-MVP]**: Users can set up schedules for automatic organization of selected folders (e.g., daily, weekly).
    

### 2.7. Undo Functionality (Critical)

- The app will implement a robust "undo" feature for the last performed organization batch. This will involve logging the original file paths and names before any moves/renames, allowing users to revert files to their previous locations with a clear command if desired.
    

### 2.8. Content-Aware Search (Potential Future Feature)

- Leverage LLM embeddings (created during organization or on-demand) to enable semantic search across organized files (e.g., "find documents about the marketing campaign with Contoso").
    

### 2.9. Enhanced Duplicate Detection (Potential Future Feature)

- Utilize LLMs to identify semantic duplicates (files with similar content but different names or minor variations) beyond simple hash-based comparisons.
    

## 3. Technical Specification

### 3.1. Frontend (macOS Application)

- **Language:** Swift
    
- **UI Framework:** SwiftUI
    
- **Rationale:** Native macOS look and feel, optimal performance on Apple Silicon, rich user experience capabilities.
    

### 3.2. Local AI (On-Device Intelligence with Ollama)

- **Framework:** Ollama ([https://ollama.ai/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Follama.ai%2F))
    
- **Ollama Detection & Management:**
    
    - Detect if Ollama is installed and running.
        
    - **Guidance Only:** Provide clear, in-app instructions and direct links to external Ollama documentation for users to install/start Ollama and download models. The app will not automate the installation process, assuming users interested in the local tier are tech-savvy enough for manual setup.
        
- **Model Selection:**
    
    - Allow users to select from their locally installed Ollama models (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral, Phi-3).
        
    - Provide recommendations for models suitable for organization tasks (balancing performance and accuracy).
        
- **API Interaction:**
    
    - The app will make HTTP requests to the local Ollama API (default: localhost:11434).
        
    - Transmit prompts, file metadata, and potentially content summaries/snippets.
        
- **Prompt Engineering:**
    
    - Development of sophisticated, adaptable prompts to instruct LLMs on analysis and organization.
        
    - Prompts will include context (current folder structure, user rules), file lists, and desired output format.
        
- **Content Handling (Privacy & Performance Focused):**
    
    - **Default:** Metadata only (filename, type, creation/modification dates, size).
        
    - **Optional (User-Enabled & Conditional):**
        
        - **User Consent Required:** Text extraction from common document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) and image EXIF data will only occur with explicit user consent. This consent will be prompted when the app determines content analysis is beneficial (e.g., if a file's title and metadata are not sufficiently descriptive for categorization).
            
        - **Multi-Stage Analysis:** If content analysis is approved, a smaller, faster local LLM via Ollama may first summarize the document. This summary, rather than the full document content, would then be used as input for the main organization LLM to balance context quality with token limits and performance.
            
    - **Privacy:** All file data and analysis for Ollama-based organization remain strictly on the user's machine.
        

### 3.3. File System Interaction

- **Framework:** Swift's FileManager API.
    
- **Permissions:** Utilize NSOpenPanel for user-granted, persistent (via security-scoped bookmarks) folder access. Adhere to Apple's privacy guidelines.
    
- **Sandboxing:** Standard Mac App Store sandboxing with appropriate entitlements for file access.
    

### 3.4. Backend & SaaS Infrastructure (for Pro Tier - Post-MVP)

- **Cloud Provider:** Firebase or AWS (e.g., AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Firebase Functions).
    
- **Authentication:** "Sign in with Apple" for SaaS tier users.
    
- **Subscription Management:** RevenueCat or Paddle.
    
- **Cloud LLM API Integration (SaaS Tier):**
    
    - Backend services (e.g., Firebase Function, AWS Lambda) will securely call third-party Cloud LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude 3, Google Gemini).
        
    - API keys for cloud LLMs will be stored securely on the backend, never embedded in the client application.
        
    - Backend can handle complex prompt chaining, fine-tuning management (if applicable), and caching.
        

### 3.5. Database (Primarily for SaaS Tier and Analytics)

- **Purpose:** Store user preferences, complex custom rule configurations (Post-MVP), subscription status, and **opt-in anonymous usage analytics**.
    
- **Options:** Firestore (Firebase), DynamoDB/RDS (AWS).
    

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Performance

- Local LLM operations should provide feedback on progress and not freeze the UI.
    
- Cloud LLM operations (Post-MVP) should handle network latency gracefully.

## 6. Monetization Strategy (SaaS Model)

### 6.1. Free Tier / Local Power-User Tier (MVP Focus)

- **Core Functionality:** Full organization capabilities using the user's local Ollama setup and models. This will be the initial MVP offering.
    
- **User Responsibility:** Running Ollama, managing models.
    
- **Limitations (Post-MVP considerations):** May eventually have caps on files per batch, limited/basic scheduling, or advanced natural language rules might be reserved for Pro tier.
    
- **Optional BYOK (Post-MVP):** Allow users to input their own API key for a cloud LLM (e.g., OpenAI), with the app managing prompts and UI, potentially with a file-per-batch limit.
    

### 6.2. Pro Tier (Monthly/Annual Subscription - Post-MVP)

- **Managed Cloud LLM Access:** Uses the app's integrated, powerful cloud LLMs via the backend (no user setup needed for this).
    
- **Benefits:** Unlimited file organization (within fair use), advanced AI-powered smart organization & suggestions, full scheduling, advanced natural language custom rules, potential for future premium features (semantic search, content summarization), priority support.
    

## 7. Key Considerations, Risks & Challenges

- **7.1. Prompt Engineering Complexity:** The quality of organization heavily depends on sophisticated and adaptive prompt design. This will require significant R&D and iteration, especially as we incorporate user feedback for refinement.
    
- **7.2. User Experience with Ollama:** Onboarding users for Ollama setup (guiding them to external resources), handling Ollama not running/models missing, and guiding model selection for optimal results are critical.
    
- **7.3. LLM Output Variability & Control:** LLM non-determinism requires a robust "Review and Approve" step. Need strategies for retries or prompt adjustments for poor/malformed LLM outputs, alongside user correction mechanisms for refining future prompts.
    
- **7.4. Performance Management:**
    
    - Local LLMs: Resource-intensive; manage user expectations, provide processing feedback.
        
    - Cloud LLMs (Post-MVP): Network latency; implement asynchronous operations.
        
- **7.5. Content Analysis & Privacy:** Absolute transparency regarding if/how file content is analyzed (always requiring user consent and using a multi-stage approach for token efficiency). Clear differentiation between local (Ollama) and cloud (SaaS backend -> third-party LLM) data flows. Comprehensive privacy policy is paramount.
    
- **7.6. Cost Management (SaaS Tier - Post-MVP):** Cloud LLM API calls can be expensive. Subscription pricing must be carefully calculated. Implement rate limiting and safeguards against abuse.
    
- **7.7. Balancing Flexibility vs. Simplicity:** The initial MVP focuses on Ollama for power-user flexibility. Later, the SaaS tier will offer simplicity at a cost. The UX must cater to both seamlessly.
    
- **7.8. File System Operation Risks:** Moving/deleting files is inherently risky. The robust "undo" feature, implemented by remembering original file states, is a critical safeguard.
    
- **7.9. User Feedback Integration:** Effectively translating user corrections and feedback into improved LLM performance (e.g., through prompt iteration or simple RLHF mechanisms) is a complex but crucial challenge.
    

## 8. Success Metrics

- Adoption: Number of downloads, active users (daily/monthly).
    
- Engagement: Frequency of use, number of files/folders organized.
    
- SaaS Conversion: Free-to-Pro tier conversion rate (Post-MVP).
    
- User Satisfaction: App Store ratings, reviews, feedback surveys, churn rate for Pro tier.
    
- Effectiveness: Qualitative feedback on the quality of LLM-generated organization, and improvements measured via internal user feedback mechanisms on LLM suggestions.
    
- Stability: Low crash rates, minimal critical bugs reported.
    
- **Opt-in Analytics:** Tracking of anonymized usage data such as types of files organized, acceptance/rejection rates of suggestions, common LLM models used, and feature usage.
    

## 9. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP/V1)

- Deeper integration for Content-Aware Search and Enhanced Duplicate Detection.
    
- Support for more file types for content extraction and analysis.
    
- Advanced rule chaining and conditional logic for natural language custom rules.
    
- User-shared rule templates.
    
- Plugin architecture for community-developed LLM interaction modules or organization strategies.
    
- Team/collaboration features for shared folder organization (complex, long-term).
    
- Fine-tuning models (either user-provided local models or managed cloud models) based on extensive user feedback/corrections for highly personalized organization (requires significant data and infrastructure).
